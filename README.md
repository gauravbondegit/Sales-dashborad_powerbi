2) COD (Cash on Delivery) reigns supreme: COD emerged as the most preferred payment method among customers, accounting for a significant portion of 43% of total transactions. This preference for COD highlights the importance of catering to customer preferences and offering flexible payment options.

While COD remains the dominant payment mode, online payments are steadily gaining ground.

3) Standard shipping reigns supreme: Standard shipping emerged as the most preferred shipping mode among customers, indicating a preference for cost-effective and reliable delivery options.

4) California reigns supreme: California emerged as the top-performing state in terms of sales, indicating strong consumer demand and a thriving business environment.

5) New York City takes the lead: New York City emerged as the top-performing city in terms of sales, solidifying its position as a global economic powerhouse and a center for commerce, finance, and culture.

6) Customers prioritize prompt delivery: The store's average delivery time of 4 days demonstrates a strong commitment to meeting customer expectations for quick and efficient order fulfillment. This dedication to timely delivery is likely to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat business.
